### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to bulid a model to predict customer service satisfaction for an airline company. 
The model uses previous customer feedback data to trian the model so that it can predict future customer satisfaction,
thereby improving customer service and satisfaction and ultimately customer retention and improved revenue generation and overall brand growth.

### Data Sources

The data for this activity includes survey responses from 129,880 airline customers. It includes data points such as class, flight distance, and in-flight entertainment, among others.

### Tools Used

- Python
  - Jupyter notebook [Download here](https://jupyter.org)
 
### Imports
Import packages
Here i imported the necessary python packages. I used train_test_split, LogisticRegression, and various imports from sklearn.metrics to build, visualize, and evalute the model
 
###  Data exploration, data cleaning, and model preparation
#### Prepare the data
After loading the dataset, I prepared the data to be suitable for a logistic regression model. This includes:

1. Exploring the data
2. Checking for missing values
3. Encoding the data
4. Renaming a column
5. Creating the training and testing data

### Model building
#### Fit a LogisticRegression model to the data
With this step I Built a logistic regression model and fit the model to the training data

### Model Evaluation
#### The following steps were taken

1. Obtain parameter estimates ( Coefficints and intercepts)
2. Print out models Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 Scorre
3. Derive insight from the values in 2 above

### Considerations 

#### Key Takeaways


#### Findings


#### Recommendations
